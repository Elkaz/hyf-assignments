1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.

I learned how to use Font Awesome icons and link them to my social media.
I also learned how to use JavaScript to change the background color and apply gradients and scrollIntoView() to create a smooth scrolling effect. It helps move the page to a specific section, like “About Me,” when I click a button.
Finally, I learned how to put my name, text, and photo in a single horizontal line and share the space evenly between them using Flex box. 

2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?

Copilot suggested a default layout for Flex box, but I changed it to use justify-content: space-between so it looked exactly how I wanted.

3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?

When Copilot generates code for us, it does most of the work , but we might not fully understand it.
Using it as a learning partner means asking why the code works and experimenting to learn from it.
It’s better to use AI as a guide and explainer, not just a code generator, so we actually grow our own skills.

4. Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.
We might not fully understand the code you’re using and It can make us less confident in solving problems on our own if we just rely on the AI as a first solution not a learning tools.
And we might make a habit of copying instead of learning, which limits our long-term growth.
Moreover, we can lose the learning pattern if we rely too much on AI, since learning works best in a spiral way, revisiting and practicing concepts to deepen understanding.
I would like to add that AI can give an illusion of knowledge, making us think we know something even if we haven’t truly understood or practiced it.
