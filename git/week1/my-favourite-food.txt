Ingredients:
    2 cups rice
    300 g chicken breast or thighs
    1 cup plain yogurt
    2 egg yolks
    1/2 tsp saffron, bloomed in 2 tbsp hot water
    3 tbsp melted butter or ghee
    Salt, pepper, turmeric — to taste
    2 tbsp oil (for the pan)
    Optional: barberries + a bit of sugar + butter for garnish

Instructions:
    Cook the chicken:
        Boil chicken with salt, pepper, and turmeric until tender. Shred and set aside.

    Cook the rice:
        Parboil rice in salted water (about 6–7 minutes), then drain.

    Make the saffron mix:
        In a bowl, mix yogurt, egg yolks, saffron water, butter, and a pinch of salt.

    Assemble:
        Mix half the rice with the saffron-yogurt mixture.
        In a nonstick pot, add oil and a layer of the saffron rice (for the crust).
        Spread the shredded chicken on top, then cover with the rest of the plain rice.

    Cook:
        Cover tightly and cook over medium-low heat for 45–60 minutes, until golden crust forms.

    Serve:
        Invert onto a platter, garnish with sautéed barberries and butter, and enjoy!
