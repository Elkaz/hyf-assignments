Ingredients:
    300 g ground beef or lamb (or a mix)
    2 medium potatoes (boiled and mashed)
    1 small onion, grated and squeezed dry
    1 egg
    Salt, black pepper, turmeric — to taste
    1/2 tsp paprika or curry powder (optional)
    Oil — for frying

Instructions:
    Prepare the mix:
        In a bowl, combine ground meat, mashed potatoes, grated onion, egg, and spices.
        Mix well by hand until smooth and sticky. Let rest 15–20 minutes.

    Shape it:
        Take a small handful of the mixture, shape it into an oval or round patty (about 1 cm thick).

    Fry:
        Heat oil in a pan over medium heat.
        Fry it until golden brown and crisp on both sides (about 4–5 minutes per side).

    Serve:
        Drain on paper towels. Serve hot or cold with bread, tomatoes, pickles, and fresh herbs.
