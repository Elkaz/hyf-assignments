Identify the components:

***********************************
1. Where is the recipe data stored?
The recipe data is stored in the Database.

*****************************************************
2. How does the frontend communicate with the backend?
The frontend communicates with the backend using HTTP requests via a Rest API.

Examples of API endpoints we I used in diagram : POST /recipes – create a new recipe or 
GET /recipes/:id – get a specific recipe  and PUT /recipes/:id – update a recipe.

The frontend sends data in JSON format, and the backend responds with JSON.

**********************************************
3. What happens when a user adds a new recipe?
When user add a new recipe, these following steps occur: 
User clicks "Add Recipe" in the frontend.

The frontend sends a POST request to the backend:
→ POST /recipes with recipe data (title, ingredients, instructions).

The backend validates the data (for example checks for missing or invalid fields).

If the data is valid:

Backend sends an INSERT query to the database.

Database saves the new recipe and returns the new recipe ID.

Backend responds: 201 Created {id: newId}

The frontend updates the UI and shows that the recipe was added.

If the data is not valid:

Backend returns 400 Bad Request

Frontend shows an error message.
