# Backend - Databases Week 1 & 2 materials

This folder contains the materials to follow along with the mentor during the Databases sessions.
It includes an example ExpressJS API and a populated SQLite database with tasks, users, and statuses.

`tasks.sqlite3` contains the SQL statements from `tasks.sql` from week1.
In case you want to recreate it, run `sqlite3 tasks.sqlite3 < tasks.sql`

To run the API:

```shell
cd example-api
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Start the server
npm run dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> Ask questions if you encounter any issues during setup.
